# Voting Protocol

1. Once an RFC is on Review for 7 days, a call for votes on a measure will be issued.
2. All members of Open Source Matters (Class 1, 2 and 3) will have the right to vote for a RFC proposal.
3. The time limit on a vote is 7 days from the time of the call for votes, or until all voting members have cast their vote, whichever comes first. Votes cast after the time limit are not valid.
4. Votes can be +1 (“in favor”), -1 (“against”), or 0 (“abstain”).
5. One-third or more of the voting members must vote within the time limit for the vote to be valid. This is the equivalent of establishing a quorum. For example:
  > - If there are 20, 21, or 22 members, then 7 or more must vote within the
   time limit for the vote to be valid.
  > - If there are 23, 24, or 25 members, then 8 or more must vote within the
   time limit for the vote to be valid.
6. The measure passes if a simple majority of the votes cast are “in favor”. The measure does not pass otherwise. For example:
  > - If there are 10 or 11 votes cast, 6 or more must be "in favor".
  > - If there are 12 or 13 votes cast, 7 or more must be "in favor".
7. Responsibility for vote tallying is shared between the member who starts a vote and the sponsors of the measure, both of whom should confirm the result.

_N.b.: “Abstain” votes are counted only for quorum, and are not counted when calculating majority._
